    Kitting is a type of materials feeding, which has been defined as (<a href="https://pure.ltu.se/ws/files/31063471/LTU-EX-08002-SE.pdf">Oskar Carlsson et al., 2008</a>):
<br><div style="padding-left: 30px;" data-canvas-width="222.6576000000001"><em>In manufacturing systems, the practice of delivering components and subassemblies to the shop floor in predetermined quantities that are placed together in specific containers is generally known as kitting.</em></div>
<br>&nbsp;
<br><div data-canvas-width="222.6576000000001">This idea is obviously much older. From doing some research, I found articles going back to 1990s describing kitting:</div>
<br><div data-canvas-width="222.6576000000001"><a href="http://www.djohn89.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/kitting-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-106 size-full" src="http://www.djohn89.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/kitting-1.jpg" alt="kitting-1" width="500" height="373" /></a></div>
<br><div data-canvas-width="222.6576000000001">The idea of using kits seems to be old even by the article titled, "Kitting versus line stocking: A conceptual framework and a descriptive model" (<a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/29734/0000070.pdf?sequence=1">Bozer and McGinnis, 1992</a>).</div>
<br>&nbsp;
<br><div data-canvas-width="222.6576000000001">One of the common complaints in the literature seems to be that kitting does not add value; it is just a form of buffering in the supply chain. A movement to make kitting leaner or remove it entirely seems to have been discussed in the mid 2000s (<a href="http://www.optelco.com/pdf/Lean-Kitting.pdf">Vujosevic, 2008</a>). But the problem at that time was that kitting was controlled by the inventory management team, which had no direct or real-time feedback from the production line. When a computerized Manufacturing Execution System (MES) was integrated into the kitting process, there was more value added.</div>
<br>&nbsp;
<br><div data-canvas-width="222.6576000000001">Skipping ahead a few years and watching some online videos (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOupf1xdkmM">Muir Omni Graphics, 2012, Youtube</a>), kitting seems to have been integrated into much more diverse applications, e.g., printing stickers on a sheet of paper. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZmBQRmDgIc">Some people consider kitting</a> to be part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5S_%28methodology%29">5S, a specific type of organization</a>. Really, all of these ideas lead back to Japanese manufacturers in the 1980s, and by that I mean <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vjdil2nBCf0">the Toyota lean manufacturing revolution</a>.Â  But since <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiichi_Ohno">Taiichi Ohno</a></b> was inspired by the efficiency of American supermarkets in the 1950s, it's fair to use the ideas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing">the Toyota Production System</a> in modern processes (e.g., kitting).</div>
<br>&nbsp;
<br><div data-canvas-width="222.6576000000001">So the origin of kitting is somewhere in either a 1950s shopping cart or a 1980s Toyota kit, but either way it's coming from lean manufacturing. I think one of the best examples of this type of manufacturing was covered in <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/403/nummi">the NPR story, "NUMMI"</a>. I highly recommend it.</div>
